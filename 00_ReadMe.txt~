# Introduction
This is a set of scripts for automatically setting up different stages of development environments based on Windows Server 2012 using powershell.

The scripts are separated into 3 stages 01, 02 and 03:
- 01 is the basic server setup setting the computer name, configuring the network (optional) and setting up the AD role
- 02 is installation and setup of SQL Server 2012
- 03 is the installation of visual studio 2013 and sharepoint 2013 (using AutoSPInstaller)

    \AutoSPInstaller 	# see credits
    \tools 		# psexec and other pstools from sysinternals.com
  \software		# software distribution for Visual Studio 2013, Sharepoint 2013 and SQL Server 2012 (each exctracted into its own directory)

# Mandatory steps

* create the directory, download the ISO files and unzip
* downloads the pstools (http://technet.microsoft.com/de-de/sysinternals/bb896649.aspx) and extract them to \automation\tools (the license restricts distribution so they can not be provided)
* review and change the powershell scripts to reflect the directory layout
* review the server name (in 01_01) and if changed make the changes to the AutoSPInstaller XML configuration
* review the account password (01_05, 03_03, AutoSPInstall XML configuration) and consistently make the appropriate changes 
* review the SharePoint configuration XML

# Reboots
Rebooting the server between the steps will not happen automatically

Reboots shoule be made:
- after 01_02
- after 01_04
- after 01_05

ï»¿The following scripts assume that:
- e: is mapped to the directory where the directories "automation" (the scripts) and "software" are located
- software contains the unzipped ISOs for visual studio 2013 ultimate, SQL Server 2012 enperpise with SP1, Sharepoint 2013 enterprise

If the directory structures are changed the path must be changed in the according sections of the ps scripts

The scripts create the guest system as development.dev.com. If changed the computername and accounts / passwords must be changed in the AutoSPInstaller script as well 

01 + 02 (optional) + 03 (make ure to enable bridging of the guest for 02)
reboot
04
reboot
05 (if visual studio hangs reboot, it will restart)
06
reboot
08
